<h3 class="section" id="Alien-architectures-1">2.6 Alien architectures</h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Alien-architectures"></a>

<p>All the above mentioned procedures expect the data to be in the format
of your machine&rsquo;s own idea of how the data has to be stored. However,
there are situations where you have to read and even write binary data
for some other, incompatible architecture.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Other-Architectures"></a>
<p>All architectures that are incompatible with the architecture,
libbinio is currently running on, are called <em class="dfn">alien</em>
architectures.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Data-conversion"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Converting-from-other-architectures"></a>
<p>libbinio makes the process of converting between your architecture&rsquo;s
and the alien architecture&rsquo;s idea of binary storage completely
transparent to you. All you have to do is to specify some
characteristics about the stream&rsquo;s binary format, after you have
opened it. All newly created streams are initialized with the current
system&rsquo;s binary characteristics, so you don&rsquo;t have to do anything if
you just want to access data of your own architecture.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Setting-flags"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Reading-flags"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Flags"></a>
<p>You use the <code class="code">setFlag(<var class="var">flag</var>, [<var class="var">set</var>])</code> and
<code class="code">getFlag(<var class="var">flag</var>)</code> methods to set and read a stream&rsquo;s
characteristics. <var class="var">flag</var> specifies the flag to be set or read
(refer to <a class="ref" href="Reference.html">Reference</a> for information on what flags are available
and their meaning). The optional argument <var class="var">set</var> specifies whether
the flag should be set (the default) or erased.
</p>
<p>After you have set up all flags to sufficiently specify the alien
architecture, you can proceed to do binary I/O, just as described in
the previous chapters and libbinio will do all the necessary
conversion between your own and the alien architecture for you.
</p>
<p>If you ever happen to have binary data of multiple, incompatbile,
alien architectures in a single stream (very unlikely), you can re-set
any of the flags to any other value, in between any of the other
stream access method calls. The stream will adhere to the new flag
values instantly with the next data access.
